Practice writing SQL queries that answer the following questions using the database we just created:

1. Who wrote the post that was shared the most times during this period? What does it say?

```{r}
library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "facebook-db.sqlite")

dbGetQuery(db, 
           "SELECT screen_name, message
           ...")

```

2. What about the post with the most comments?

```{r}


```

3. Which was the post that received the most likes in January of 2017?

```{r}


```

4. What was the photo posted by a Member of Congress that received the most "angry" reactions?

```{r}

```

5. What was the post by `senatorsanders` that received the most "angry" reactions? And the most "love" reactions?

```{r}

```

6. Which was the post mentioning "Trump" that was shared the most? And which was the post that received the most "love" reactions?

```{r}

```
