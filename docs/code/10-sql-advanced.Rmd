## Querying multiple SQL tables

Now's where we get to see the magic of SQL. It makes it really easy to combine multiple SQL tables using __JOIN__. We just select columns from different tables and then specify what _key_ should be used to match them using __ON__. 

The example belows shows an __inner join__, but there are other types (left vs right outer joins, cross joins...) that we will not cover in this workshop.

```{r}
library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "facebook-db.sqlite")

dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT posts.likes_count, congress.party, posts.date
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  LIMIT 10")
```

Once we know how to merge tables, we can use columns from both tables. For example, let's say we want to find the most shared post by a Democrat, or by a Republican. Here's how we would do it:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT posts.from_name, posts.message, posts.shares_count, congress.party 
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  WHERE party = 'Democrat'
  ORDER BY shares_count DESC
  LIMIT 1")
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT posts.from_name, posts.message, posts.shares_count, congress.party 
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  WHERE party = 'Republican'
  ORDER BY shares_count DESC
  LIMIT 1")
```

## Grouping and aggregating

SQL makes it really easy to compute aggregate statistics of one column based on values of a different column, with a series of built-in functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN...). Let's now see a few examples of this type of queries:

```{r}
# use COUNT with * to return the total number of rows
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts')
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM congress')
```

Combining everything we've learned, we can for example count the total number of posts by party, or by party and gender.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT congress.party, COUNT(*) AS total_posts
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  GROUP BY congress.party")

dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT congress.party, congress.gender, COUNT(*) AS total_posts
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  GROUP BY congress.party, congress.gender")
```

Here's another example. Let's say we want to look at what domains Republicans and Democrats share more frequently on their Facebook pages. How would we do this?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT congress.party, domain, COUNT(*) AS domain_count
  FROM posts JOIN Congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  WHERE congress.party = 'Democrat'
  GROUP BY domain
  ORDER BY domain_count DESC
  LIMIT 20")

dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT congress.party, domain, COUNT(*) AS domain_count
  FROM posts JOIN Congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  WHERE congress.party = 'Republican'
  GROUP BY domain
  ORDER BY domain_count DESC
  LIMIT 20")

```

There are other functions besides just __COUNT__. We can also compute averages, the maximum and minimum of a column, the sum... We can also functions like __SUBSTR__ to extract parts of a character string.

```{r}
# average number of posts by party
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT congress.party, AVG(posts.likes_count), COUNT(*) 
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  GROUP BY congress.party")

# we can also compute it in a different way...
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT congress.party, SUM(posts.likes_count)/COUNT(*) AS average 
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  GROUP BY congress.party")

# most popular post by party
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT from_name, message, congress.party, MAX(posts.likes_count), COUNT(*) 
  FROM posts JOIN congress
    ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
  GROUP BY congress.party")

# number of posts by day of the month
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT SUBSTR(date, 9, 10) AS day_of_month, COUNT(*) as post_count
  FROM posts
  GROUP BY day_of_month")

```
