Citizens across the globe spend an increasing proportion of their daily lives on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. Their activities leave behind granular, time-stamped footprints of human behavior and personal interactions that represent a new and exciting source of data to study standing questions about political and social behavior. At the same time, the volume and heterogeneity of social media data present unprecedented methodological challenges. The goal of this course is to gain the skills necessary to automate the process of downloading, cleaning, and analyzing social media data using the R programming language for statistical computing.

We will follow a "learning-by-doing" approach, with short guided coding sessions followed by data challenges that will prompt participants to practice what they just learned. Given the applied nature of the course, there will be no required readings, but students are expected to complete and submit the data challenges before the beginning of the second and third sessions.

# Prerequisites

The workshop assumes familiarity with the R statistical programming language. Participants should be able to know how to read datasets in R, work with vectors and data frames, and run basic statistical analyses, such as linear regression. More advanced knowledge of statistical computing, such as writing functions and loops, is helpful but not required.

Students are expected to bring a laptop to class and follow along the coding section of each session.

# Software 

This course will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface to R. 

Installing R or RStudio prior to the workshop is not necessary. The instructor will provide individual login details to an RStudio Server that all workshop participants can access to run their code.
